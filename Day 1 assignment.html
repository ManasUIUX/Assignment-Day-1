        The Indian team management has dismissed claims that using a concussion substitute for Ravindra Jadeja in <br>
        Canberra was a tactical move,insisting that the call was made purely to safeguard their all-rounders health<br>
        A senior team official has confirmed to Cricbuzzthat the decision was taken only after Jadeja had complained<br>
         about feeling groggy and dizzy upon returning to the dressing-room following his unbeaten 23-ball 44 on Friday. <br>
        The official then also went on to reveal the exact sequence of events that led to Yuzvendra Chahal taking the <br>
        field in place of Jadeja.And how it all started with Sanju Samson spotting the left-hander helmet <br>
         watching the replay of the ball in the dug-out.Sanju was the first one to see it.  <br>
         He immediately informed Mayank (Agarwal), who was seated next to him, that the blow was <br>
         flush on the helmet.And Mayank then ran up to inform the team management, the source said.

        India and England over the years have taken contrasting approaches in the first powerplay.<br>
        While England go hard at the bowlers right from the word go, Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan<br>
        are generally content being there out in the middle by the end of the 10th over and then picking pace.<br> 
        In the opening ODI, India were 39/0 after 10 overs whereas Jonny Bairstow and Jason Roy scored 50 <br>
        in the same phase. For a side that has believed in conserving wickets and going hard at the death, <br>
        India ended up making 126 in the final 10 overs on Friday (March 26) but their tactic of going pretty <br>
        easy on the England spin attack perhaps cost them 25-30 odd runs.
